    "AMRClaw and GeoClaw version 5.6.1 (and earlier) allow specifying rectangular refinement regions (see [www.clawpack.org/regions.html](http://www.clawpack.org/regions.html)) in `setrun.py` in the form of a list that is appended to `rundata.regiondata.regions`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rundata.regiondata.regions.append([minlevel,maxlevel,t1,t2,x1,x2,y1,y2])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a region that is active from time `t1` to `t2` over the spatial extent `[x1,x2,y1,y2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified version of AMRClaw/GeoClaw supports a new approach to specifying regions that I propose calling `flagregions`.  This will also support simple rectangles and so should ultimately replace `regions` in both AMRClaw and GeoClaw.  The name `flagregions` is more descriptive of the function served by these regions and may cause less confusion with other uses of the word \"region\" in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The class `FlagRegion` discussed below is currently implemented in a separate module `data_FlagRegions.py` but should eventually be moved into `clawpack.amrclaw.data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new way of specifying a flag region in `setrun.py` is to first define an object `flagregion` of class `FlagRegion`, set various attributes of this object (including `minlevel`, `maxlevel`, `t1`, `t2`, and a spatial extent), and then append this object to `rundata.flagregiondata.flagregions`.  Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "flagregion = data_FlagRegions.FlagRegion(num_dim=2)\n",
    "flagregion.name = 'Region_AdmiraltyInlet'\n",
    "flagregion.minlevel = 4\n",
    "flagregion.maxlevel = 5\n",
    "flagregion.t1 = 3600.\n",
    "flagregion.t2 = 1e9\n",
    "flagregion.spatial_region_type = 2  # Ruled Rectangle\n",
    "flagregion.spatial_region_file = os.path.abspath('RuledRectangle_AdmiraltyInlet.data')\n",
    "rundata.flagregiondata.flagregions.append(flagregion)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the spatial extent in this case is specified by a path to a file that describes a Ruled Rectangle, in this case one that covers Admiralty Inlet as defined in one of the examples of  [RuledRectangles.ipynb](RuledRectangles.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple rectangles (like the old \"regions\") can be specified via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "flagregion.spatial_region_type = 1  # Rectangle\n",
    "flagregion.spatial_region = [x1,x2,y1,y2]  # the extent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the time being, one can also specify regions the old way and can specify both \"regions\" and \"flagregions\" in the same `setrun.py`.  The former are written out to `regions.data` as always and the latter are written out to `flagregions.data`, and both sets of regions are read in by code in `region_module.f90` and used in `flagregions2.f90`.  The new versions of these files are in this repository in `new_fortran_amrclaw`.  \n"
