# New features to be added to v5.7.0

You can view html rendered versions of the Jupyter notebooks that describe the proposed changes at
http://www.clawpack.org/new_features_for_v5.7.0/notebooks_html/Index.html.

To execute the notebooks, clone the repository and open 
`notebooks/Index.ipynb`.

The other directories contain the new code, which will be added to various clawpack repositories via a sequence of PRs separating out some of the distinct changes.
